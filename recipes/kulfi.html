        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Kulfi is best described as Indian-style ice cream. However, unlike ice cream, kulfi is not churned. This is a fantastic summer dessert. This is a quick and easy version of kulfi. I almost never make kulfi the old way any more.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups whole milk</li>
            <li>½ cup condensed milk</li>
            <li>¼ cup dry milk powder</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons white sugar, or to taste (Optional)</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon ground cardamom</li>
            <li>1 pinch saffron threads</li>
            <li>¼ cup chopped pistachio nuts</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Stir the milk, condensed milk, and dry milk powder together in a heavy-bottomed pan and bring to a boil. Add the sugar, cardamom, and saffron to the boiling milk; reduce heat to low and simmer, stirring frequently, for 10 minutes. Remove from heat and allow to cool to room temperature; fold the pistachio nuts into the mixture.</li>
            <li>Pour the mixture into popsicle molds and freeze until solid, about 1 hour</li>
        </ol>
